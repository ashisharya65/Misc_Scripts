# PowerShell scripts to create Event Triggered schedule tasks
1. This repo contains the scripts which I used recently to create event triggered schedule task on Intune managed VMs so as to shutdown the unused VMs.
2. The [DeviceShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1](https://github.com/ashisharya65/My-PowerShell-Scripts/blob/main/WindowsMachines/ScheduledTask/EventTriggeredSchdTask/DeviceShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1) script will be creating the Scheduled task for monitoring the user log off event (event id - 4647) and will shutdown the device whenever the event is generated.
3. The [Reset-ShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1](https://github.com/ashisharya65/My-PowerShell-Scripts/blob/main/WindowsMachines/ScheduledTask/EventTriggeredSchdTask/Reset-ShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1) script will be creating the Scheduled task for monitoring the user connect event and whenever the event is generated, it will reset the scheduled task which was created by [DeviceShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1](https://github.com/ashisharya65/My-PowerShell-Scripts/blob/main/WindowsMachines/ScheduledTask/EventTriggeredSchdTask/DeviceShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1) script.
