# PowerShell scripts to create Event Triggered schedule tasks
This repo contains the scripts which I used recently to create event triggered schedule task on Intune managed VMs so as to shutdown the unused VMs.
1. The [DeviceShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1](https://github.com/ashisharya65/My-PowerShell-Scripts/blob/main/WindowsMachines/ScheduledTask/EventTriggeredSchdTask/DeviceShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1) script will be creating the first Scheduled task for monitoring the user log off event (event id - 4647) and will shutdown the device whenever the event is generated.
2. The [Reset-ShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1](https://github.com/ashisharya65/My-PowerShell-Scripts/blob/main/WindowsMachines/ScheduledTask/EventTriggeredSchdTask/Reset-ShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1) script will be creating the second Scheduled task for monitoring the user connect event and whenever the event is generated, it will reset the first scheduled task on the device which was created by [DeviceShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1](https://github.com/ashisharya65/My-PowerShell-Scripts/blob/main/WindowsMachines/ScheduledTask/EventTriggeredSchdTask/DeviceShutdownEventTriggeredSchdTask.ps1) script. To reset the first scheduled task [Reset.ps1](https://github.com/ashisharya65/My-PowerShell-Scripts/blob/main/WindowsMachines/ScheduledTask/EventTriggeredSchdTask/Reset.ps1) script will be used by the second scheduled task.
